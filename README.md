# ESP32_SandBox

This repository is my personal space to learn and practice programming the ESP32 board using PlatformIO. It contains example projects, experiments, and code snippets to build practical skills and explore ESP32 features.  
I will keep updating it with new projects as I gain experience.

## Requirements

- ESP32 development board  
- USB cable to connect the board to your PC  
- USB-to-Serial drivers installed (e.g., CP2102 or CH340 drivers depending on your board)  
- PlatformIO IDE (recommended as a VS Code extension)  
- Basic knowledge of C/C++ and microcontroller programming

## Projects in This Repository

- `01_HelloWorld/`  
  A simple "Hello World Blinky" program for ESP32.  
  Used to verify flashing, serial communication, and basic board operation.

- `02_HW_info/`  
  Prints detailed ESP32 system and hardware information over Serial.  
  Includes chip ID, flash specs, memory stats, and WiFi diagnostics.

More project folders will be added as development continues.
